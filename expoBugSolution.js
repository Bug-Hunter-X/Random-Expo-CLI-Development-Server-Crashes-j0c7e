Debugging random crashes is difficult.  However, here are some steps that might help:

1. **Check Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI.  Outdated versions might contain bugs. Run `expo update`.
2. **Check Logs:** Examine the Expo CLI logs carefully. Even if it doesn't display a clear error, there might be hints. 
3. **Simplify Your App:** If possible, try to reproduce the crash in a minimal, stripped-down version of your application to identify which part of the code causes the issue.
4. **Check for Memory Leaks:** Excessive memory usage might lead to crashes. Investigate if your application has any significant memory leaks.
5. **Check Dependencies:** Update and examine your project's dependencies.  Conflicts or bugs in certain packages could lead to crashes.
6. **Restart Your Machine:** Sometimes, the simplest solution is to reboot your computer to clear system resources.
7. **Check Device/Simulator Resources:** Ensure that the simulator or device you're using has enough resources to run your application smoothly.
8. **Reinstall Expo Go (if using):** If using Expo Go, try reinstalling it.
9. **Clean the project:** Run `expo start --clear` to clean the project cache.
10. **Create a new project:** As a last resort, creating a new Expo project and gradually transferring your code might help you identify the issue-causing parts of your codebase.
