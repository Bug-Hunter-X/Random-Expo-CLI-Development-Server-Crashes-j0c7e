# Random Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing clear error messages. This issue significantly impacts the development workflow by causing intermittent crashes and making debugging difficult.

## Bug Reproduction

The `expoBug.js` file contains a simplified example that sometimes leads to the issue (although the exact conditions are not consistently reproducible).  More details on this are provided in the bug report.

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution and/or workaround for the issue.  However, please note that a more comprehensive fix may depend on the root cause of the random crashes in your particular project setup.

## Additional Notes

This issue often occurs when you have specific environment configurations that interact badly with Expo.  A closer review of your `package.json` and `app.json`/`expo.json` configuration files may be in order.
